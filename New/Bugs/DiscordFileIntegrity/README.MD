# What?

Well, whilst messing around in discords files I soon noticed that Discord basically checks no files and you can put your own JS
into your client, although sure, this is cool but I mean come on Discord. Custom clients against your ToS yet you don't check files properly?? I'm a bit over this discord.

# PoC

Go into `discord_desktop_core` and edit index.js with whatever javascript you want. Just don't change the first line. Amazing, right? Same goes for many other files :/

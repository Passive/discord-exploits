# Discord File Integrity
Discord does not check local file integrity. This allows an attacker to run their own code without any sort of detection
within your client. For anyone developing malware this is a neat way to gain persistence on a victim's
computer.

## Fix
All Discord needs to do to fix this is
> Check file integrity against builds considered 'up to date'.
> 
> If not a match, direct user to download new build and scan pc.

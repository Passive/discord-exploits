# How does this work?

Well, I tried it with firefox and it did not work. But with chromium it hung the browser and CPU shot up to 20%.
I would like to hear more about how this works! If you have any info hmu on discord (~shash#4214)

I found this on cxsecurity, so enjoy!

I believe this is something to do with RegEx!!

# How to use it?

Open up your dev console and paste in the following.

```
/((?<!\\)("(\\.|[^\\"]+)+"|""|('(\\.|[^\\']+)+')|''|(`(\\.|[^\\`]+)+`)|``))/.test("\": *Aug Asd sdsd assadsd sdasdadad dsdas dasd 20:29823:837 10:00:10");
```

To kill discord use task manager.

# How does this work?

Well, when you send an image in a discord chat your computer caches it so it loads faster next time.
Sure this is good and all but windows defender likes to nitpick at all your files. So when we put some
malicious code in the images, windows defender scans it and says, "Oh no! Trojan dropper!!1!". Please keep in
note this isn't discord specific and you can probably do it on the likes of telegram and guilded.

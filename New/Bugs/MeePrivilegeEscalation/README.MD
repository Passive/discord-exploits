# Privilege escalation

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-working-%23bd42a">

Currently Mee6 and Dyno have role issues, with Mee6 you can get roles higher than yours using reaction roles.

# What does this mean?
This means MEE6 and Dyno can be exploited by a lower ranking moderator to gain Administrator
permissions.

**Fix: Make sure these bots rank lower than important roles.**

# How does it work? And what is this.

Well, When you sign up at discord.com you get given a captcha, once done you are good to go. But then if you make another account you get no captcha. This carries on for as long as you need. Although discord put extra verification measures in place you can use the EmailVerify exploit (in the exploits folder) to actually make email verified tokens.

# Examples

Well, I actually used this to make 600 accounts (allegedly, discord don't ban me)

# Fix this discord!

Discord can fix this, its as simple as that. Don't you think they should make you do another captcha after 2 accounts or so?

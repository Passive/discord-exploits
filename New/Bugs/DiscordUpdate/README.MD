# Discord bugs go brrrrr

This bug arised when 2welve showed me a part of discords uri scheme. It seems this is outdated and no longer used. For some reason it forces your discord to update on restart and deleted my index.js in `discord_desktop_core`. This is a way to annoy people with custom clients >:)

# How it works

Just post `<discord://invite-proxy/anythinghere>` and wait for the clicks to pile up.

# Awesome, what is this?

Well, if you do not know Discord runs off of electron soooo you can use ChromeDevtoolsProtocol to hook it.

HellSec brought this to my attention and it can be dangerous. You can actually redirect people using it. If the port is open
on someones router it can be potentially fatal. But this is intended and cannot be counted as an exploit or bug.

# Guide

This is a guide on how to bypass discords virus detection when sending files. So, I actually haven't looked into what discord uses for checking files but I will boldly assume it is VirusTotal. In order to evade detection you need the score to be low. In order to accomplish this I recommend making a seperate file that downloads your virus and then runs it.

# Other methods

Some other methods are...
  - Use external links
  - Try double zipping it. Put it in a zip file and put that zip file in another zip file.
  - Try changing up the code, or adding some junk code.

If anyone has more please DM me on discord!

## Captcha Bug
Discord does not give a captcha after completing one, this is now patched (24/01/2022)

### Examples

Well, I actually used this to make 600 accounts (allegedly, discord don't ban me)

### Fix this discord!

Discord can fix this, its as simple as that. Don't you think they should make you do another captcha after 2 accounts or so?
